# Equity Research Module

Read this file when the user requests analysis of a single listed company, financial statements, competitiveness, valuation, holding alerts, or a single-stock investment recommendation.

## Sole Primary Responsibility

Be responsible for single-stock fundamental research, industry and competition analysis, multi-method valuation, and single-stock decisions. Do not be responsible for portfolio-level capital allocation, options-structure design, historical strategy backtesting, or transaction execution. Concrete trade requests route to `trade-planning` for a user-executed manual plan only.


## Input Contract

| Field | Requirement | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ticker` | Required | Stock ticker or uniquely identifiable company name; use a list for multi-security comparisons |
| `market` | Conditionally required | Provide when the ticker is ambiguous across markets |
| `detail_level` | Optional | `brief`, `standard` or `deep`, default `standard`; preserve the user's requested depth |
| `focus` | Optional | financials, valuation, competition, catalysts, risks, technical confirmation, etc. |
| `holding_context` | Optional and sensitive | quantity, cost basis and holding period; for holding alerts only |
| `as_of` | Optional | Data cutoff date; default to the most recent available data and disclose |

## Yahoo Finance Use

Use the available approved read-only operations under [data-source-policy.md §Yahoo Finance via Prime AI Agent Data API](data-source-policy.md#yahoo-finance-via-prime-ai-agent-data-api): `chart` for historical or delayed price context, `profile` for secondary company descriptors, `holders` for ownership screening, `insights` for clearly labeled provider analytics, and `filings` only to discover official filings. Inspect the actual returned fields and preserve source, observation/retrieval dates, symbol, query and adjustment basis in working records. Financial statements, valuation-critical facts, capital structure and filing evidence still require issuer, exchange, regulator or direct filing sources; Yahoo Finance is never an execution-grade quote.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the security and paradigm. Confirm market, security type and analysis cutoff date; determine whether current pricing is primarily driven by earnings quality, growth expectations, asset value, cyclicality, events, or liquidity.
2. Build the factual working paper. Collect business segments, financial statements, guidance, valuations, prices, expectations and material events. When Yahoo Finance is used, inspect actual fields and retain source and query context before using any values. Record facts, company disclosures, market-consensus expectations, provider analytics and analytical assumptions in separate columns.
3. Analyze fundamentals. Assess growth quality, profit and cash conversion, capital efficiency, balance sheet, accounting anomalies and key unit economics. Do not present metrics alone; explain drivers.
4. Analyze industry and moat. Clarify market structure, competitors, substitutes, customer and supplier bargaining power, entry barriers, and evidence that could weaken the moat.
5. Construct valuation. Select primary methods matching the pricing paradigm, and execute the public metric dictionary [`metric-dictionary.md §General Valuation Discipline`](metric-dictionary.md#general-valuation-discipline) (declare primary methods, cross-validate, produce bear/base/bull three scenarios, run sensitivity and constrain parameters); reference all formulas and definitions to the public metric dictionary and do not rewrite them in this document.
6. Assess expectation gaps and catalysts. Distinguish expectations already priced in from potential new information; provide catalyst time windows and observable evidence.
7. Formulate the single-stock conclusion. Output the recommendation, confidence, valuation range, core arguments, risks, monitoring items and failure conditions. If technical entry is needed, output only research-layer confirmation conditions and do not substitute for the trade planning module.
8. Holding alerts. Only evaluate three classes of alerts—fundamentals, expectations and price—when the user provides holding context; do not expose unrelated account identifiers in results.

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Failure Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Security identification | Security and market uniquely identified | Ask one clarifying question |
| Data timeliness | Key data include dates and sources | Lower confidence and list gaps |
| Financial consistency | Statement periods, currencies and accounting bases are consistent | Normalize first; avoid direct comparison until standardized |
| Valuation reproducibility | Inputs, formulas, units and scenarios are traceable | Do not output pseudo-precise target prices |
| Argument balance | Include both supporting and opposing evidence | Add counter-evidence before concluding |

## Handover Rules

| Request Extension | Call Chain |
|---|---|
| Design an options strategy for the stock | `equity-research` → `options-strategy` |
| Decide how much to buy across the portfolio | `equity-research` → `portfolio-management` |
| Backtest technical or factor strategies | `quant-backtesting` |
| Generate a concrete manual trade plan, including a prohibited request to place, modify, or cancel an order | `equity-research` → `trade-planning`; the user must implement any transaction independently |
| Prepare IC, roadshow, or ECM materials | `equity-research` → `corporate-finance` (`research-materials-pack` / `ecm-company-profile`) |
| Compare funds or ETFs | `fund-etf` |

## Delivery Requirements

Present the investment view, valuation scenarios, supporting and opposing evidence, catalysts and monitoring items relevant to the request.

Preserve the user-selected source, metric basis, scope and output. Follow [output-contracts.md](output-contracts.md) for delivery and [completion-evidence.md](completion-evidence.md) for the actual applicable checks. Keep material facts, units, dates, assumptions, risks and gaps traceable without forcing headings or an internal object into the response.
