description: Use the session's enabled Google Workspace connector through gws, with rclone reserved for bulk sync or binary transfer. Applies when Workspace CLI is available, not to the legacy Drive-only branch.

# Google Workspace Integration

Apply when `google_drive_enabled=true` and `gog_cli_disabled=false`. Use current session context for `device_only_execution_enabled`, `long_sandbox_execution`, and optional `google_workspace_scopes`.

When scopes are supplied, follow their enabled services and access levels: `READ` is read-only; `FULL` permits reads and writes.

## Device-only or Long Sandbox

Plain `gws ...` and `rclone ...` retain the user's existing local configuration. When choosing the enabled Google Workspace connector, use:

```sh
"$PRIME_AI_AGENT_CONFIG_HOME/connectors/google/gws" <args...>
```

In PowerShell:

```powershell
& "$env:PRIME_AI_AGENT_CONFIG_HOME\connectors\google\gws.cmd" <args...>
```

Before first use, check whether `gws` is installed. If missing, install the official native release on the user's computer and report the exact error if installation fails. Do not run `gws auth login` or change the user's gws configuration. Run the connector wrapper with `--help` before first use to learn available services and subcommands.

Use the connector rclone wrapper only as a fallback for bulk sync or binary upload/download, with the fixed remote `prime_ai_agent_google_drive:<path>`:

```sh
"$PRIME_AI_AGENT_CONFIG_HOME/connectors/google/rclone" <args...>
```

In PowerShell:

```powershell
& "$env:PRIME_AI_AGENT_CONFIG_HOME\connectors\google\rclone.cmd" <args...>
```

Check whether rclone is installed first. If missing, install it with an available system package manager or an official native release. Never run `rclone config` or pass `--config` in this mode.

## Other Sandbox execution

Use the preconfigured `gws` CLI through `exec`. Run `gws --help` before first use to learn available services and subcommands.

Use rclone only as a fallback for bulk sync or binary upload/download:

```sh
rclone <command> [args...] --config /home/ubuntu/.gdrive-rclone.ini
```

The fixed remote is `prime_ai_agent_google_drive:<path>`.
