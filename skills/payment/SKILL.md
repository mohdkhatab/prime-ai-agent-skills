# Payment

Use current session context to determine `stripe_link_enabled`, `device_only_execution_enabled`, `long_sandbox_execution`, and `isCoordinatorSubtask`.

## Stripe Link enabled

Prefer Link: generate a virtual card and use it to complete website checkout on the user's behalf.

- For Device-only or Long Sandbox execution, read [Link on Device-only and Long Sandbox](references/link-runtime.md) before running Link commands or handling the approved card.
- For other Sandbox execution, read the available `link-payment` skill before making any payment.

If Link cannot complete checkout, such as merchant rejection or Link unavailability, use the user takeover workflow below. If the user declines a spend request, ask how they want to proceed instead of falling back automatically.

## Stripe Link disabled

Do not make purchases or payments on the user's behalf, and do not read `link-payment`.

- In a coordinator subtask, use takeover only if the coordinator says the user will pay with their own card. Otherwise, stop and report that Payments is not enabled for this Agent; do not ask the user to change settings.
- In a main task, use takeover. You may mention that enabling Payments in Prime AI Agent settings permits Link payments and that Link usually can only be set up in the United States.

## User takeover

Bring checkout to the payment step, then use `ask` with `take_over_browser` so the user can enter their own card details and complete payment. Never ask for card details in messages or offer that as an alternative. In a main task, never read or enter the user's own card details yourself.

For adding or updating a payment method in a coordinator subtask, read [Temporary card and billing forms](references/temporary-card-forms.md). Adding a card does not require Payments to be enabled. Filling or saving a card does not authorize payment; the user completes their own-card payment and bank or 3DS approval.

Review provenance: [original payment block](references/original-block.txt). The temporary-card reference also preserves the specific dependency that the original payment block called “described above”; it does not migrate the rest of the communication block.
